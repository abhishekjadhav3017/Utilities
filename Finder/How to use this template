This document contains brief instruction on how to use this template.

Prerequisites:

1. The development machine must have Visual Studio (2012 is preferred but any version will work) and .NET framework installed on it.
2. SQL Server must be installed (preferably SQL Express).
3. Silicus Nuget Repository is setup in Visual Studio. If not, go to VS Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Settings. 
In the options window, click on "Package Sources", on right hand side, select + button to add new package source. Enter a name in Name 
text box and Enter following URL into Source text box "\\Silpunnas1\SilicusNugetStore". If you can not access this network path, please 
take help from IT team.

Instructions:

1. Download the source code from the GitHub. You can clone the master repo or download as a zip file (on right hand side menu).
2. Open the sln "Silicus.MvcTemplate.sln" file in Visual Studio.
3. Right click the solution in VS and select "Restore Nuget Packages" from context menu. You can also do it from Package Manager setting
  window.
4. While building the solution VS will download required packages and build successfully.
5. In case of error building one or more projects, build project individually.
6. Once the project is built successfully, open Web.Config file and make following changes.

6.a Change the connection string as per your SQL Server instance name. You can either create a DB user and add his credential
into connection string with "Integrated Security=false" or you can use "Integrated Security=true" in which case application
will connect to SQL Server with windows authentication.
6.b You will need membership DB aspnetdb by name "Silicus_ASPNETDB". Run following command to create a new membership DB.

"C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regsql.exe"

For a step by step instruction refer this "http://weblogs.asp.net/sukumarraju/installing-asp-net-membership-services-database-in-sql-server-expreess". 
Please note that you should use ".\SQLExpress" as server name (or else change connection string in web.config as per the 
server name).

Following are the users which are created:
 
1)      Username : testadmin@test.com
 
Password : testadmin@123
 
Role : Admin
 
2)      Username : testuser@test.com
 
Password : testuser@123
 
Role : User

6.c Change following app key values based on DB name selected in connection strings:

  <add key="DBName" value="SilicusMvcTemplateDB" />
  <add key="MembershipDBName" value="Silicus_ASPNETDB" />

Reuse-able Components
 
While all of the template is designed to be used by any green field project below components can be reused in any other project independently:
 
1.	Silicus.Logger – A simple library that implements a Database Logger which is very simple to use. Maintain log level and does logging asynchronously. Fail safe (never throws, logs in windows event viewer).
2.	Silicus.Auditing – A simple library provide ability to add business events into database (separate). Audit information can be changed based on project needs.
3.	Silicus.Core – A class library that provides common core functionality. Guard class provides input validation against NULL and Empty for various datatypes. EncryptionHelper provides ability to encrypt or decrypt strings.
 
Features
 
1.	Authentication (Form based) and Authorization using SQLMembershipProvider
2.	Both filter based and explicit logging is demonstrated.
3.	Filter based auditing is demonstrated.
4.	Exception Handling (Different error view for different HTTP error code) is demonstrated.
5.	User Account Management – Added two default users in two different roles. Login, Forgot Password, Change Password, Reset Password, Auto logoff after x hours, etc. 
6.	Data Access Layer – Fully working and ready to use EntityFramework based library demonstrated.
7.	CRUD Operation with DB – End to End communication
8.	Send Email
9.	Publish profile – two profiles demonstrated with web.config transformations
10.	Unit test cases added for sample controller and classes.
